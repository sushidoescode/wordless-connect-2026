# WORDLESS Relay — annotated prompt and decision log

This log records the human direction, model-assisted research, material
decisions, failures, verification, and deviations for the Connect submission.
Planning claims are not implementation evidence.

## 2026-08-24 — Competitive brief and independent review

**Human direction**

Review the Organize winners, the public Guide field, Sensei's companion web
application, and the existing Connect ideation. Select an idea that is unique
enough to stand out, useful or emotionally resonant, instantly understandable,
and resistant to predictable LLM convergence. The owner expressed a preference
for WORDLESS but asked for adversarial vetting rather than automatic agreement.

**Model work**

- OpenAI GPT-5.6 Sol performed the initial Connect research and idea generation
  referenced by the owner.
- Anthropic Fable 5 performed an independent competitive and concept review;
  its supplied memo is archived at
  `docs/research/fable-connect-verdict-original.md`.
- OpenAI Codex independently audited the memo, official Snap documentation,
  PackSpace, Sensei, and the wider discoverable Guide field.

**Decision**

WORDLESS remains the selected concept, but the architecture changed from two
remote Spectacles clients to one Spectacles client plus one browser participant.
Current official Connected Lenses documentation contradicts remote two-Specs
play; official Snap Cloud material documents a plausible bidirectional
Lens↔web route. The approved design begins with a hard feasibility spike.

**Evidence status**

Research complete; implementation not started. Snap Cloud account access,
runtime compatibility, latency, and capture quality remain unproven gates.

## 2026-08-24 — Architecture approval

**Human approval**

> I approve of the WORDLESS Relay direction.

**Locked scope**

One Lens Preview painter, one browser guesser, one bounded continuous stroke,
four choices, Lens-authoritative validation, correct/incorrect feedback, and an
exact-path glyph medallion. No game feature work begins before the realtime
spike passes.

## 2026-08-24 — Visual-reference generation

**Human action**

The owner ran the prompt preserved in
`docs/prompts/visual-reference-prompt.md` through Gemini Nano Banana and ChatGPT
image generation and supplied three outputs.

**Review result**

- ChatGPT output selected as the compositional north star.
- Higher-resolution Gemini output selected as the palette/UI companion.
- Alternate Gemini output retained for restrained stroke and HUD framing only.

**Provenance and use restriction**

All three images are external AI-generated design references. They are stored
under `docs/references/visuals/` in the private repository and are forbidden as
runtime, web, demo-video, or submission assets. Production visuals must be
recreated from original deterministic primitives.

**Implementation status**

No visual shown in these references has been implemented or verified.

## 2026-08-25 — Agent-native implementation-plan directive

**Human direction**

The owner approved the WORDLESS Relay design and requested the implementation
plan before build. The plan must account for LLM implementation speed rather
than human sprint pacing, use the speed dividend for substantially more visual
polish and clarity iteration, and make the experience immediately legible to a
layperson and the judges. After the plan, Fable 5 will review it independently;
only a reconciled plan will be handed to a fresh implementation session.

**Current technical research**

- The official challenge page requires Lens Studio 5.22 or later and a SPECS
  project; this machine currently reports Lens Studio 5.23.1.
- Snap documents Realtime Broadcast and a bidirectional 10 Hz Lens↔web cursor
  pattern through its Supabase-powered Snap Cloud alpha.
- Current public examples span older Spectacles 2024 and newer SPECS branches.
  The plan therefore makes installed Asset Library packages and generated types
  authoritative and puts entitlement, Preview auth, and genuine two-way traffic
  behind Gate 0.
- The browser plan uses framework-light Vite TypeScript and ordinary
  `@supabase/supabase-js`; the Lens remains the result authority.

**Plan decision**

The implementation is divided into evidence-sized tasks, not hour estimates.
Gate 0 proves realtime before game work; Gate 1 proves the complete vertical
slice and freezes features. The remaining work is explicitly reserved for
visual craft, five-second blind comprehension, accessibility, resilience,
capture rehearsal, and claim/evidence quality.

**Review state**

The plan and two handoff prompts are written for independent review. No Lens,
web application, cloud project, credential, or runtime behavior has been
created or claimed by this planning entry.
